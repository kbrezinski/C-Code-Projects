# C-Code-Projects
 
A series of practice solutions and projects for the course CS50:

**caesar.c** - a implementation of the caesar cipher than prompts a user for a cipher and decodes a message.

**cash.c** - calculates the ammount of change to return (in coins) given a user is prompted for a dollar ammount.

**crack.c** - creates a salt and utilizes the crypt C library to encode a password to compute the password hash.

**credit.c** - implements Luhn's algorithm to validate credit card numbers, and identify their maker (deprecated).

**mario.c** - create a series of blocks, created as ASCII characters, that mimic the block formations in the super mario brothers video game series.
